This Repo contains simple console based java project - ATM interface 

where I designed an ATM interface using JDBC and MySQL Workbench! 

1. Database Setup with MySQL Workbench:
Started by creating a robust database schema to store user accounts, transaction history, and more. MySQL Workbench made it a breeze to design and implement.

2. Connecting Java with MySQL using JDBC:
Integrated the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API to establish a secure connection between the ATM application and the MySQL database. This seamless connection ensures real-time updates and retrieval of user information.

3. Implemented a secure login system to authenticate users against the database. Leveraged JDBC's prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and enhance security. Authorization levels were set to control access to specific functionalities.
Looking forward to incorporating additional features.

Thank You!!
